		<h2>What is HospitAlert?</h2>
		<p>It's everyone's worst nightmare: A loved one has been hospitalized and you are unable to be there with them.
		If someone is at the hospital with them, keeping everybody up-to-date with calls and texts may be too overwhelming.
		Social media is fast and easy, but it isn't very private. With HospitAlert, you and your family members can
		all stay up-to-date in a fast, secure location.</p>
